# Project Name
Weather Graphical User Interface (GUI) Application

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to get experience collecting data from an available application programming interface (API), collect and work with user input, and display information based on the input back to the user.

This project was a requirement for one of my introductory courses during my Data Science Master's program at Bellevue Univerity

### Methods Used
* API Data Ingestion
* GUI (receive and display info to the user)

### Technologies
* Python (tkinter for GUI creation)

## Project Description
This project creates a very sipmle GUI that accepts user input and queries an exposed weather API from the website [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/). The user is able to query weather information based on their desired location by entering either the city name or zip code. The application also allows the user to filter the weather data with either imperial or metric units. After the program returns the queried data, it re-prompts the user for another location, otherwise the program closes.
